# Progress Log

### 2026-08-26

- Brainstormed project direction: world models + SO-101 arm.
- Landed on research question: sim-to-real transfer comparison between a
  TD-MPC2-style world model (with online planning) and a diffusion policy
  (LeRobot's implementation), on a single pick-and-place task.
- Confirmed simulator choice: NVIDIA Isaac Lab.
- Confirmed scope: focused (one task/object), no fixed timeline.
- Set up project structure and documentation:
  - `docs/project_plan.md`
  - `docs/preferences.md`
  - `docs/questions_log.md`
  - `docs/decisions.md`
  - `docs/progress.md` (this file)
- Set up remote project root at `~/SO-101-WM` on the Ubuntu machine
  (`keerthan@100.71.12.16`), confirmed passwordless SSH access working.
- Local mirror established at `c:\Keerthan\Projects\SO-101-WM`.

**Status**: Planning complete. Next step is building the SO-101 Isaac Lab
scene (asset import + minimal scripted pick-and-place task).
